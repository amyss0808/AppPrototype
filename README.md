# FangZ
> ### **An iOS APP for real estate video collecting**

A lot of people spend plenty of time and money looking for their ideal houses. Moreover, housing disputes often arise due to information asymmetry. 

Thus, we developed FangZ to simply overcome the two problems.

We provide more information of the environment around the house. To be more specific, video recorders record videos and upload to FangZ, while potential house buyers can watch video to gain information.
